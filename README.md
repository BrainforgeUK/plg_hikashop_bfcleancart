This plugin performs the following functions:
<ul>
<li><b>Cleans the cart when an order is confirmed.</b>
<br>This can be useful when you have several confirmed / paid order states such as:
<br>'Paid by PayPal', 'Paid by Worldpay', 'Paid by Telephone' etc and not the more usual single 'confirmed' state.</li>
<li><b>Prevents robots from creating a cart and adding items to a cart.</b>
<br>i.e. the #__hikashop_cart table does not fill up with these.</li>
<li><b>Run Hikashop cart cleanup when an item is added to a cart</b>.
<br>See Hikashop configuration advanced settings for retention period and check frequency.</li>
</ul>
